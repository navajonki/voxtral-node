# Environment: Termux on Android

- Do NOT use `sudo`.
- Do NOT try to open GUI windows.
- If you need to write files, use the current directory (`./`).
- Assume standard linux tools like `curl` and `git` work, but `flutter` commands will fail locally.
- Flutter builds happen in CI (GitHub Actions), not on this device.
